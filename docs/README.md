## How to run

Docs use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a static generator in Ruby, to create this blog.

## First steps

1. Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/pt/downloads/), in case you don't have them yet.

2. Once installed these dependencies, open up the terminal and install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with the following command:

```sh
$ gem install jekyll jekyll-paginate jekyll-gist --user-install
```

3. Now clone the project:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:raphamorim/rio.git
```

4. Navigate to the project folder:

```sh
$ cd docs
```

5. And finally run:

```sh
$ jekyll serve
```

You'll have access to the website at `http://0.0.0.0:4000/`.
